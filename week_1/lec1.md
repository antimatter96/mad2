## L1.3: Basics of JavaScript

### Statement and Expression

-> Piece of code that can be executed
-> Piece of code that can be executed to obtain a value to be erturned

### Data Types

-> boolean number string, bigint, symbol [undefined and null are primitive data types]
-> Objects (can have function -> methods)
-> Functions (can be handled like objects) (can have associated objects)

Which of the following encoding does a JavaScript engine use in general?

- UTF-16

Which of the following have a block-level scope in JavaScript language?

- let
- const

What is ECMAScript?

- It is a JavaScript standard.
- It was designed to ensure the inter-portability of webpages across the browsers.

## L1.4: JavaScipt - Identifiers, Expressions, and Variables

### Operators and coercion

```js
3   +  4  => 7
'3' + '4' => '34'
3   + '4' => '34'
'3' +  4  => '34'
'3' * '4' => 12
```

```js
3==4
3==3

3=='3'
3==='3'
3===3

undefined == null
undefined === null

```

Prefer `===`

## L1.5: JavaScript - Control Flow and Functions

`undefined`:
- not initialized
- unknoiewn state

`null`
- excplicit non value


`const`
- immutable object
- values cannot be changed once reassigned
- object, keys, values can be changes

`let`
- variable that can be updated


```js
for(const x = 0; x < 5; x++) {
  ...
}
for(let x = 0; x < 5; x++) {
  ...
}

const v = [1,2,3,4]
for(const x in v) {
  x : 0, 1, 2, 3
}
const v = [1,2,3,4]
for(const x of v) {
  x : 1,2,3,4
}
```

### Functions

functoin add(x, y) {
  ...
}

--OR--

// returns anonymous func assign to add
let add = function(x, y) {

}

--OR--


let add = (x, y) => x + y;


let x = function() {  } // anon function

(function() {}()); // declare and invoke

IIFE -> Immedistely invoked function expression/execution

`typeof` -> return type of variable

```js
const x
=> Uncaught SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration
```


```js
const x = { a : 1 };

obj.double = function(i) { this.a = i * this.a }

obj.double(2)

x === { a: 2}
```

## L1.6: JavaScript - DOM API

Inputs ->
Outputs ->


```js
let d1 = document.getElementById('');
d1.innerHTML = '';

d1.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
  x++;
  d1.innerHTML = '';


  d1.style.fontSize = '';
});

```


```js
async function x() {
  await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 2000));
  ...
  ..
}

x();
```


```
let x
x -> undefined
```



---

```js
const onj2 = {
  n: 'A',
  cN: (_n) => {
    this.n = _n; // WHAT IS THIS ??
    // --OR--
    n = _n; // WHAT IS n ??
  },
};
```

```js
const abc = {
  n: 'a',
  arr: null,
  normal: function() {
    this.arr = () => { console.log(this.n) }; // now arr knows that this is abc
  },
};
```
